        <h2> Request a Mirror </h2>
        <p> 
            We are always looking for new projects to add to Mirror! If there's 
            something you'd like to see added, please create a <a href="https://github.com/COSI-Lab/Mirror/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=mirror-request.md&title=%5Bmirror-request%5D+%3Cname+of+project%3E">github issue</a>
            or email us at <a href="mailto:mirroradmin@clarkson.edu">mirroradmin@clarkson.edu</a>. We mirror most projects with <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a> however it's not absolutely required.
            It's helpful if you can provide some necessary information about the project. For example, a link to the infrastructure documentation on how to mirror it properly.
